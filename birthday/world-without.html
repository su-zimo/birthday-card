    <h1>colors </h1>
    <h2> without any exaggeration you made my life colorful</h2>
    <p> 

I wish you a happy year full of energy and success. I once told you that you added colors to my life, and I wasn’t exaggerating. I was miserable and had lost all passion; life played with me the same way Messi plays with the ball. Despite my strong personality and my patience, I was still in need—
in need of someone to hold me in moments of failure and tell me not to worry, someone who would celebrate my smallest victories as if they were their own, someone whose embrace would push me to persevere and never give up.
And that’s where your role appeared, and even more.
My other half, my love for you cannot be captured in words, but I hope I can at least share a piece of it.
